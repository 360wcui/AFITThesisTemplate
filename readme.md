# AFIT Latex Thesis Template

This template is an update of the 2014 work accomplished by Dr. Magnus.  

Updated by BBurfeind:
A few changes were made to conform with the 2015 AFIT Style Guide and I replaced the proprietary acronym handling with the glossaries package.  See https://ctan.org/pkg/glossaries?lang=en.

Updated by lcintron:
Added packages for algorithms, fixed issues with glossary, IEEE bibliography, appendices, and page layout.
