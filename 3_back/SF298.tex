\Abstract{
Emerging distributed-ledger networks are changing the landscape for environments of low trust among participating \\[-1pt] entities. Implementing such technologies in transportation infrastructure communications and operations would enable, \\[-1pt]
in a secure fashion, decentralized collaboration among entities who do not fully trust each other. This work models a\\[-1pt] transportation records and events data collection system enabled by a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network and \\[-1pt]
simulated using a transportation environment modeling tool. A distributed vehicle records management use case is shown \\[-1pt]
with the capability to detect and prevent unauthorized vehicle odometer tampering. Another use case studied is that of\\[-1pt]
vehicular data collected during the event of an accident. It relies on broadcast data collected from the Vehicle Ad-hoc \\[-1pt]
Network (VANET) and submitted as witness reports from nearby vehicles or road-side units who observed the event \\[-1pt]
taking place or detected misbehaving activity. The experimental testbed shows that Hyperledger Fabric and other \\[-1pt]
distributed ledger technologies hold promise for the collection of transportation data and the collaboration of applications\\[-1pt]
and services that consume it.
